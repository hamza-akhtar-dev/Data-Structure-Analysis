Given 6 files of data, containing 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000 and 1000000 records, respectively. The data in the files starts with the keyword “$Records” on the first line, followed by the number of records on the 2nd line, and from the 3rd line onwards, records are present in the file. Each record consists of 4 pieces of information about an employee:

3. Find records
4. Delete half of the data from the data structure

For each operation, record the execution time and memory consumption. The data structures for which these operations are to be performed are:
a) Hash Table (Quadratic Probing)
b) Array
c) Linked List
d) Tree
